    <p>
      A croissant is a light, flaky, crescent-shaped pastry made from a yeasted,
      laminated dough. It's essentially a type of puff pastry that is known for
      its buttery flavor and airy, layered texture. Croissants are a popular
      breakfast food and are often enjoyed with coffee or tea.
